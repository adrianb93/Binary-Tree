#About this project

This is an example of my understanding of a basic data structure (a binary tree) shown in C++. 

This project demonstrates a binary tree of students and their grades. The assignment sheet from the uni course has been included in this repository to provide some context.

#Notes

Before running, I recommend having your terminal window minimum 140 characters wide. 

Type the following into your terminal (one line at a time).

	cd ~/PATH_TO_PROJECT/project
